###### **Beginner Level**
1. Balanced Parentheses
   * Given a string containing just the characters (, ), {, }, [ and ], determine if the input string is valid (i.e., all brackets are closed in the correct order).
2. Next Greater Element
   * Given an array, find the next greater element for each element. If no greater element exists, return -1 for that position. 
3. Reverse a String using Stack
   * Given a string, reverse it using a stack. 
4. Evaluate Postfix Expression
   * Given a postfix mathematical expression, evaluate its result.
5. Implement Stack using Queue
   * Implement a stack using only queue operations (push, pop, peek, etc.).

###### **Intermediate Level**

1. Sort a Stack
   * Given a stack, sort it using only stack operations (no extra data structures other than an auxiliary stack).
2. Stock Span Problem
   * Given daily stock prices, determine the number of consecutive days before each day when the price was lower or equal to the current price.
3. Implement Min Stack
   * Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
4. Remove K Digits
   * Given a number represented as a string and an integer k, remove k digits to get the smallest possible number.
5. Find the Largest Rectangle in Histogram
   * Given an array of heights representing bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed.

###### **Advanced Level**
1. Trapping Rain Water
   * Given an array representing heights of bars, determine how much water can be trapped between the bars after rain.
2. Maximum Rectangle in a Binary Matrix
   * Given a binary matrix of 0s and 1s, find the largest rectangle of 1s.
3. LRU Cache Implementation
   * Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache using a stack (or a combination of stack and other data structures).
4. Decode String
   * Given an encoded string like "3[a]2[bc]", decode it to "aaabcbc".
5. Expression Evaluation (Infix to Postfix & Postfix Evaluation)
   * Convert an infix mathematical expression (like "3 + 5 * 2") to postfix and evaluate it.
